## Technology stack ##

- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as task runner

#### Styles ####
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) as CSS preprocessor
- [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) plugins
    - [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) takes care of vendor prefixes

## Getting started ##

You need to have `node` and `gulp` installed. If you have them, you just need to run this task.
```
  npm install
```
It will install nodejs dependencies then run `gulp` to generate files in public directory.

## CSS components ##

The starter kit includes a [style guide](http://base.iconpaper.org/guide.html) displaying all CSS components.

All components are in `em` so you can control their sizes with the font size of their parent. Using `rem` on values that are not meant to be relative.
